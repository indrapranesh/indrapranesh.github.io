	<h2>Life Saver Bot</h2>
	
	<p>Our project is a life saver chatbot linked with the Facebook messenger app. When someone requests for an ambulance at the time of emergency ,the location of the user will be sent to the nearby ambulance driver based on the availability. This chatbot based interface uses the GPS of the mobile and sends the location to the nearby ambulance drivers. The location of the user is shared to the ambulance driver the shortest directions to reach the spot is generated using Google maps API .Bots makes the life easier.Instead of having separate app on your phone to do the same task, we can use this bot with existing one. It is potentially a better way to contact an ambulance rather than calling the ambulance service and explaining the location.</p>
